Description: The oblique decision tree (ODT) uses linear combinations of
    predictors as partitioning variables in a decision tree. Oblique
    Decision Random Forest (ODRF) is an ensemble of multiple ODTs
    generated by feature bagging. Both can be used for classification and
    regression as supplements to the classical CART and Random Forest
    respectively.
