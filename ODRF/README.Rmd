The goal of ODRF is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of ODRF from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liuyu-star/ODRF")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ODRF)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of regexcite is to make regular expressions more exciting!
It provides convenience functions to make some common tasks with string manipulation and regular expressions a bit easier.

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
      
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/regexcite")
```

## Usage

A fairly common task when dealing with strings is the need to split a single string into many parts.
This is what `base::strplit()` and `stringr::str_split()` do.

```{r}
(x <- "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta")
strsplit(x, split = ",")
stringr::str_split(x, pattern = ",")
```

Notice how the return value is a **list** of length one, where the first element holds the character vector of parts.
Often the shape of this output is inconvenient, i.e. we want the un-listed version.

That's exactly what `regexcite::str_split_one()` does.

```{r}
library(regexcite)

str_split_one(x, pattern = ",")
```

Use `str_split_one()` when the input is known to be a single string.
For safety, it will error if its input has length greater than one.

`str_split_one()` is built on `stringr::str_split()`, so you can use its `n` argument and stringr's general interface for describing the `pattern` to be matched.

```{r}
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",", n = 2)

y <- "192.168.0.1"
str_split_one(y, pattern = stringr::fixed("."))
```
