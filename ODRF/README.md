# ODRF

The goal of ODRF is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of ODRF from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liuyu-star/ODRF")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
#library(ODRF)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of regexcite is to make regular expressions more exciting! It
provides convenience functions to make some common tasks with string
manipulation and regular expressions a bit easier.

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/regexcite")
```

## Usage

A fairly common task when dealing with strings is the need to split a
single string into many parts. This is what `base::strplit()` and
`stringr::str_split()` do.

``` r
(x <- "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta")
#> [1] "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta"
strsplit(x, split = ",")
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
stringr::str_split(x, pattern = ",")
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
```

Notice how the return value is a **list** of length one, where the first
element holds the character vector of parts. Often the shape of this
output is inconvenient, i.e. we want the un-listed version.

That’s exactly what `regexcite::str_split_one()` does.

``` r
library(regexcite)

str_split_one(x, pattern = ",")
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
```

Use `str_split_one()` when the input is known to be a single string. For
safety, it will error if its input has length greater than one.

`str_split_one()` is built on `stringr::str_split()`, so you can use its
`n` argument and stringr’s general interface for describing the
`pattern` to be matched.

``` r
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",", n = 2)
#> [1] "alfa"                "bravo,charlie,delta"

y <- "192.168.0.1"
str_split_one(y, pattern = stringr::fixed("."))
#> [1] "192" "168" "0"   "1"
```
